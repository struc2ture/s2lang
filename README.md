# s2 to do
- parsing more different expression types: unary operations; different operands for binary, etc.
- precedence
- block node + one-line ifs, etc.
- structs
- type checking
- diagnostics: where error happened
- assignment - a binary op?
- do-while
- semantic analysis on break and continue (only in loops and switch)
- switch-case
- proper code gen indentation
